## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Calligraphr

Characters were ripped from [#100Devs](https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon) classes. 

## Optimizations
- Include numbers
- Include symbols
- Include different casing options
- Improve site styling
- Improve handwriting overall

## Lessons Learned:
This was my first time creating a custom font. It was extremely easy using Calligraphr's template model. This allows you to upload an image of your characters rather than drawing them out.
